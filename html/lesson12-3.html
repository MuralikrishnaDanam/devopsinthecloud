                        <p>There are 5 steps you might go through in making a process part of a Continuous Delivery system: document, test, script, version, and make it continuous. When you consider a process that needs to be part of a Continuous Delivery system, your question should be, “How is the process being accomplished now?”. For instance, let’s say you’ve got s deployment process. At a very high level, the process might be to stop an application server, copy a binary artifact, modify database connections and start the server. So, the first thing you’d do is.</p>

                            <p>You will document the process or refine existing process so that it can be automated. Writing documentation in this manner is significantly different than how most people write documentation because you can’t make any assumptions. Essentially you need to write it the way a program might read it. One of the main purposes of this to so that you’re able to repeat the process manually.</p>
